========================================================================


**Objectives:**

   2.  To use the skip thought vector encoding for sentences.

   3.  To construct Deep Convolutional GAN and train on MSCOCO and
    CUB datasets.



**Related Theoritical concepts**
--------------------------------

**A**.  **Skip-Thought Vectors**
--------------------------------

Skip-thought model \[1\] is an unsupervised encoder-decoder model for
encoding large chunks of text irrespective of the application domain.
This approach is novel in the sense of shift from compositional
semantics based methods, while maintaining the same quality.
The input to this model, while training, is a tuple of sentences
![alt text](https://github.com/ayansengupta17/GAN/blob/master/common/tex/1.gif). The encoder generates a state vector
![alt text](https://github.com/ayansengupta17/GAN/blob/master/common/tex/2.gif) corresponding to words
![alt text](https://github.com/ayansengupta17/GAN/blob/master/common/tex/3.gif) of the
sentence ![alt text](https://github.com/ayansengupta17/GAN/blob/master/common/tex/4.gif) at time step
![alt text](https://github.com/ayansengupta17/GAN/blob/master/common/tex/5.gif). One of the two decoders predicts
the word ![alt text](https://github.com/ayansengupta17/GAN/blob/master/common/tex/6.gif) in the next sentence
![alt text](https://github.com/ayansengupta17/GAN/blob/master/common/tex/7.gif) and the other
decoder predicts the word ![alt text](https://github.com/ayansengupta17/GAN/blob/master/common/tex/8.gif)
in previous sentence
![alt text](https://github.com/ayansengupta17/GAN/blob/master/common/tex/9.gif) from the current state vector
![alt text](https://github.com/ayansengupta17/GAN/blob/master/common/tex/2.gif). The objective
function is sum of log probabilities of forward and backward sentences
given the encoder representation

   ![alt text](https://github.com/ayansengupta17/GAN/blob/master/common/tex/10.gif)

![alt text](https://github.com/ayansengupta17/GAN/blob/master/common/images/skipthought.png)

 In simpler terms, maximizing the sum of log probabilities would lead
 to generation of a faithful state vector which encodes information
 required to make predictions about the nearby sentences.

 Another important feature proposed in \[2\] is vocabulary expansion.
 The vocabulary for this RNN based model, represented as
 ![alt text](https://github.com/ayansengupta17/GAN/blob/master/common/tex/11.gif), is relatively small as compared to other
 representations like word2vec, represented by ![alt text](https://github.com/ayansengupta17/GAN/blob/master/common/tex/12.gif). A
 transformation ![alt text](https://github.com/ayansengupta17/GAN/blob/master/common/tex/13.gif) can constructed
 such that ![alt text](https://github.com/ayansengupta17/GAN/blob/master/common/tex/14.gif),
 such that ![alt text](https://github.com/ayansengupta17/GAN/blob/master/common/tex/15.gif)
 by minimizing L2 loss to obtain W.

**B**.  **Generative Adversarial Networks**
-------------------------------------------

 ![alt text](https://github.com/ayansengupta17/GAN/blob/master/common/images/gan.png)

 Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) \[2\] consists of a generator
 G responsible for generating examples from noise distribution
 ![alt text](https://github.com/ayansengupta17/GAN/blob/master/common/tex/p_g.gif),
 parameterized by ![alt text](https://github.com/ayansengupta17/GAN/blob/master/common/tex/theta_g.gif), which are similar to the data
 distribution and a discriminator D, responsible for distinguishing
 the examples arising from the data distribution ![alt text](https://github.com/ayansengupta17/GAN/blob/master/common/tex/p_d.gif), parameterized
 by ![alt text](https://github.com/ayansengupta17/GAN/blob/master/common/tex/theta_d.gif), against those generated by G.

 The requirements for this framework to generate examples
 indistinguishable from the data distribution are:

1.  The discriminator D should maximise the probability of correctly classifying the the source of examples.

2.  The generator G should maximise the probability that D incorrectly classifies the the generated examples.

 This is a minimax game between G and D as:

 ![alt text](https://github.com/ayansengupta17/GAN/blob/master/common/images/gan_equation.png)

 The training of GANs is difficult and success of GANs has been
 demonstrated by using MLP based generators and discriminators. It is
 observed that discriminator can be safely trained while generator is
 halted, but training generator while discriminator is halted leads to
 Mode Collapse \[3\] where generator generates almost identical images
 which can deceive the discriminator. Hence, the training of
 discriminator and generator has to go hand in hand.

**C**.  **Generative Adversarial Text to Image Synthesis**
-----------------------------------------------------------

![alt text](https://github.com/ayansengupta17/GAN/blob/master/common/images/model.png)

 Caption to image generation has been addressed in \[4\]. The
 underlying idea is to augment the generator and discriminator in a GAN
 with suitable text encoding of the description. Conceptually, this is
 similar to conditioning the operation of the generator and
 discriminators on the text descriptions. The original work describes
 the implementation using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks hence the
 name DCGAN. The generator is a deconvolution network which generates
 an image from the text based on noise distribution. The discriminator
 is a convolutional network which outputs the probability of the input
 image belonging to the original data distribution given the text
 encoding.

 It is the loss function of the network that we changed in to get
 varying results. As already mentioned the discriminator is a
 Convolutional Neural Network which was trained on two aspects:

1.  It should be able to differentiate between a generated image and an original image for the same image description in text

2.  The discriminator should be able to differentiate between a real image and fake text

 The naive GAN involves the discriminator network understanding to
 differentiate between a realistic image and fake text and unrealistic
 image and original text. As pointed out in \[4\] we note that this
 might lead to training complications. Therefore we modify the loss
 function of the discriminator to include one more source of loss where
 we penalise the discriminator when it is fed with realistic images
 with fake text. This technique called Matching Aware GAN therefore
 includes three parts in the loss functions:

1.  Realistic images with original text

2.  Unrealistic images with original text

3.  Realistic images with fake text

**Implementation**
-------------------

 We now mention the DCGAN architecture that we have used for our
 training. Further modifications that have been made are mentioned
 thereafter.

 Before diving into architecture, it is worth noting that the
 inaccuracies in text encoding could affect the results drastically.
 Hence, text descriptions were encoded using a pre-trained model for
 skip-thought vectors as spending resources on training a text encoder
 from scratch is only secondary to the scope of this project. From
 implementation point of view, this decision is justifiable as the
 versatility of this model due to vocabulary expansion can address any
 scalability issues arising at a later stage.

**A**.  **Generator Architecture**

    1.  After noise is appended to the encoded sentence, we use a 
        deconvolutional neural network (referred to as convolutional nets
        with fractional strides in [6]). We use 5 layers for 
        the Generator network which are described as follows:

    2.  Generate 128 dimensional conditioning latent variable using 
        twofully connected layers to map from 4800 dimensional sentence encoded
        vector to mean and sigma predictions.

    3.  Sample epsilon from normal distribution and generate the 
        conditioning variable.

    4.  Append conditioning variable with noise latent variable which is
         100 dimensional.

    5.  Map the appended vector into 4x4x1024 tensor using a fully
         connected layer and reshape the same.

    6.  A deconvolutional layer with filter dimension 3x3. Stride length
         of 2 is used giving an output of 8x8x512. Leaky ReLU
         activation is used with the slope as 0.3 as suggested
         in [7]. Padding used is ‘SAME’. The output is
         batch normalized.

    7.  A deconvolutional layer with filter dimension 3x3. Stride length
         of 2 is used giving an output of 16x16x256. Leaky ReLU
         activation is used with the slope as 0.3. Padding used is
         ‘SAME’.The output is batch normalized.

    8.  A deconvolutional layer with filter dimension 3x3. Stride length
         of 2 is used giving an output of 32x32x128. Leaky ReLU
         activation is used with the slope as 0.3. Padding used is
         ‘SAME’.The output is batch normalized.

    9.  A deconvolutional layer with filter dimension 3x3. Stride length
         of 2 is used giving an output of 64x64x3. Sigmoid activation
         is used in this layer. Padding used is ‘SAME’.

**B**.  **Discriminator Architecture**

    1.  Map the sentence vector into 4x4x128 tensor using a fully
         connected layer and reshape the same.

    2.  A convolutional layer with filter dimension 3x3 over the
         input image. Stride length of 2 is used giving an output
         of 32x32x64. Leaky ReLU activation is used with the slope
         as 0.3. Padding used is ‘SAME’. Dropout with keep probability
         0.7 was used.

    3.  A convolutional layer with filter dimension 3x3 over the
         input image. Stride length of 2 is used giving an output
         of 16x16x128. Leaky ReLU activation is used with the slope
         as 0.3. Padding used is ‘SAME’. Dropout with keep probability
         0.7 was used.

    4.  A convolutional layer with filter dimension 3x3 over the
         input image. Stride length of 2 is used giving an output
         of 8x8x256. Leaky ReLU activation is used with the slope
         as 0.3. Padding used is ‘SAME’. Dropout with keep probability
         0.7 was used.

    5.  A convolutional layer with filter dimension 3x3 over the
         input image. Stride length of 2 is used giving an output
         of 4x4x512. Leaky ReLU activation is used with the slope
         as 0.3. Padding used is ‘SAME’. Dropout with keep probability
         0.7 was used.

    6.  Outputs from 1 and 5 are augmented along channels.

    7.  A convolutional layer with filter dimension 3x3 over the
         input image. Stride length of 2 is used giving an output
         of 1x1x1024. Leaky ReLU activation is used with the slope
         as 0.3. Padding used is ‘SAME’. Dropout with keep probability
         0.7 was used.

    8.  Reshaped to a one dimensional vector and then converted to a
         single value using a fully connected layer. No activation used
         in order to use **tf.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits()**
         to generate a probability implicitly

**C**.  **Loss Functions**

 The cross-entropy loss function that we use for the discriminator
 network forces it to produce 1 when a correct image sentence pair is
 given to it and 0 otherwise. However such hard outputs is generally
 not desirable for training the discriminator network. This is because
 for a correct image-sentence pair the discriminator may try to push
 its output to 1 even when it is actually giving 0.9 as output (say).
 Therefore we modify the cross-entropy loss function slightly by
 requiring it to give an output of 0.9 when sentence-image pair is
 correct and 0.1 otherwise. This technique has been called
 “Level-Smoothing”.

 The losses used for the generator network include the obvious binary
 cross entropy loss with level smoothened probabilities. In addition to
 this loss, KL divergence between the conditioning latent variable
 distributed over mean and variance predicted by initial layers of the
 generator network and the zero mean unit variance normal distribution
 is taken. This follows from the reparameterization trick. Also the
 lagrange multiplier of 2.0 for the KL divergence loss follows from
 \[7\].

**D**.  **Batch Normalization**

 As Xavier weight-initialization and ReLu activation functions helps
 counter the vanishing gradient problem, Batch Normalization is another
 method for handling the problem of vanishing gradient as well as
 exploding gradients. Batch Normalization is a method to reduce
 internal covariate shift in deep neural networks, which leads to the
 possible usage of higher learning rates \[8\]. After normalizing the
 input in the neural network, we don’t have to worry that the scale of
 input features might be vastly different. Thus, the gradient descent
 can reduce the oscillations when approaching the minimum point and
 converge faster. Again Batch Norm also reduces the impacts of earlier
 layers on the later layers in deep neural network. Beside all the
 positive effects, still a side-effect of Batch Normalization is
 regularization. By using mini-batch size, a minor noise will be added
 to each layer, which imposes the regularization effects. But the
 regularization effects decrease with larger batch size since the noise
 diminishes.

**E**.  **Reparameterization Trick**.

 The reparameterization trick is used to transform the encoded sentence
 vector to a conditional variable needed for the Generator. As we have
 seen in the Variational Autoencoder setup, the reparameterization
 trick helps us in enabling the gradients flow through a stochastic
 node. This also helps mitigate the learning problems from an encoder
 output space which is ginormous and the vectors of concern might be in
 sparse and discontinuous subspaces. Thus the space is converted to
 simple space (normally distributed) to make the task of learning
 easier.

**Approaches:**
---------------

**A**.  **Without Batch Normalization**

 Depth of the Generative Network was varied (its depth was always <=
 depth of the Discriminator network). Since it is generally better if
 the Discriminator network is better trained than the Generator, we
 changed the architecture keeping in mind that the final loss of the
 discriminator should be less than that of the generator. This was
 however very difficult to achieve while training with MS-COCO dataset.

 The model sizes we made were restricted by the GPU’s we used.

**B**.  **With Batch Normalization**

 Once Batch Normalization was added, the training was much faster. We
 could train the model on the MS-COCO dataset for a batch size of upto
 8 on one of the machines. We noticed the introduction of noise as
 batch normalization was done for smaller batch sizes. Having batch
 sizes of greater than 8 was not feasible for the machine that we were
 using for this training.

**A**.  **Batch Normalization and Conditional Augmentation**

 This approach proved to be the best in generating low resolution
 images. The idea was based on the Stage I implementation of StackGAN
 and the model was created using the description in the same
 implementation. Also, high resolution images could be generated by
 using a SRGAN (Super Resolution GAN ) as Stage II of the same but due
to lack of resources and time we could not train the model.

 The key aspect of this approach was to use reparameterization trick
 and generate a continuous and more meaningful distribution out of the
 encoded sentence vectors before augmenting it with noise to feed in
 the generator’s decoder part. This has shown that the generated images
 follow the description better.

**Experiments**

 This project was developed in Python 3.5 using **tensorflow-gpu
 v1.50**, **numpy**, and **pickle**. Total length of the codes are

 his graduate seminar.
